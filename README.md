This project was conducted in pair with Aksel Acar, as a final project for the EPFL course COM-112(a) - Programmation orient√©e projet(https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/programmation-orientee-projet-COM-112-A). 

The goal was to create an ant-like simulation from scracth, including several type of ants, colonies and living-dying behaviours. The goal of a colony is to grow, and for this collector ants go collect food in random places. As to dominate the playfield, the generator ant (queen) can also generate predator ants to track down other collector ants, as well as defensor ants to protect the inside of the colony.

The entirety of the project was coded in C++ by either Aksel Acar or Emilien Coudurier. For additional information, see the report (written in french).
